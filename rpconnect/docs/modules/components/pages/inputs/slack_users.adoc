```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
input:
  label: ""
  slack_users:
    bot_token: "" # No default (required)
    team_id: ""
    auto_replay_nacks: true
```

Reads all users in a slack organization (optionally filtered by a team ID).

== Fields

=== `bot_token`

The Slack Bot User OAuth token to use.


*Type*: `string`


=== `team_id`

The team ID to filter by


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
